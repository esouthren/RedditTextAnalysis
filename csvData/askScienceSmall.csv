2,it depends on the case  each surgical procedure and each medical treatment in general is a special case  and the requirements evaluated for a patient suffering from some health disorder meet a criteria which is distinctive of the treatment  in most cases  that criteria used for some specific treatment has been changing throughout history  each criteria has been changed for better until today  and it will probably keep changing over time  sometimes a new research  for a specific treatment and a specific health disorder  proposes a small change on the criteria used to say if a patient should or should not undergo that treatment ,d02fomc,askscience,learning,1455660474.0,Dimakhaerus,1.0,0.0,335,933,0.0
